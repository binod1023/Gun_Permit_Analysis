# gun_license_analysis 
This is a brief analysis of gun licensing and permits of US states. The data has been collected from National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS. I completed this project as a part of Udacity Data Analyst Certification. The data set has gun license permitted in US states. It includes data on different types of gun permitted on each state.
